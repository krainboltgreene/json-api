title: "JSON API: Specification Status"
---

JSON API is at a third release candidate state. This means that it is not yet
stable, however, libraries intended to work with 1.0 should implement this
version of the specification. We may make very small tweaks, but everything is
basically in place.

Work on this specification is being done at its [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/json-api/json-api). Please feel free to help
flesh it out or, if you try to write an implementation, to tell us where things
were ambiguous. The best way to do so is to [file an
Issue](https://github.com/json-api/json-api/issues).
